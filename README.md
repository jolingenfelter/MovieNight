# MovieNight

This is an app designed to help a pair of people decide on a movie to watch.  Both users take a turn selecting 5 genres and then 5 movies out of those genres, and after they can view a list of their combined choices to help with the decision making process.  Movie information is gathered from The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org).
